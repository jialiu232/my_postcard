## Bio

I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program in Iowa State University. Research-wise, I am passionate about promoting sustainable agriculture from the soil microbiome perspective. In particular, I am interested in improving the detection of microbial functional genes that are involved in the
important soil processes, such as nitrogen cycling. Previously, I developed MetaFunPrimer, a command
line-based pipeline in Bash and Python to design primers for high-throughput qPCR. My common work involves analyzing
sequencing data such as 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenome sequencing, and RNA sequencing, data
analysis and visualization. Outside of my research, Iâ€™m interested in data science, programming, and
learning new technologies.
